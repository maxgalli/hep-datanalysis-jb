## Probability

- random variable distribution instead of probability distribution / link between the two
- difference between a random variable X and its realization x
- Sampling form a distriution $X \sim p_X$ / Not much used in the skript but useful for ML
- probability mass function and probability density function (discrete / continuous)
- p(x) can be greater than 1 for continuous vars
- cumulative distribution in n-dim relation to joint distribution
- conditional probability re-normalized to 1 - the denominator has changed you need to do that...
