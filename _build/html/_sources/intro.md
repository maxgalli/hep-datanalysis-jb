The goal of the course is to enable the reader to "extract information" from experimental data. The more ambitious goal on the other hand is to develop in the reader that skeptical attitude that allows her/him not to fall in the trap so sharply summarized by the Feynman's quote above.

Our main concern will be the understanding of the methods used to analyse data in physics experiments and avoid to come to wrong conclusions because blindly applying recipes.


It's really a journey in learning from what surrounds you "the data".
Please always remember that we leave our lives submerged in data. Newspapers, TV programs, social media, they all present us an immense amount of data. Often (always) they are accompanied by some pre-digested interpretation. The data are the data: once you know when/where/who/how they were taken, you can build your own interpretaion and compare / challenge the predigested one.

It is not easy and it doesn't come quickly: it's a mental habit that needs to be build daily. All numbers (be physics measurement or else) have to make sense !

Develop a critical eye in front of the data

What checks do you want to perform to convince yourself (or a reviewer) that your results are correct ?

Develop the habit of looking for the data and build your own understanding. Pre-digested interpretations are often superficial, biased or simply wrong

Analyse data means understanding the world around you and take informed decisions.
